As I was unable to attend the exhibit It was difficult for me to comprehend how the 
exhibit was set up and what tales the artwork represented because I was unable to attend. 
I was able to appreciate the significance of the curator's choice in the art works to 
display after reading Eloise's blog entry from the perspective of a visitor. The phrase 
"most innocent role is those artists" truly speaks to be in retrospect of an artist piece 
being displayed at a museum. What I understood from this is that while an artist may have 
a reason for making this art have a backstory, it is not in the artist's control whether 
it resonates with a viewer or curator. Everyone's definition of art is unique. Many people
"argue that art can't be defined," according to a piece by Marilna Maraviglia, which, in my
opinion, goes back to the idea that an artist is innocent and explains why Eloise used the 
analogy of guests being given a "represented meal" in her article. In order for me to create
my own visual impression of the exhibit, Eloise also provides a thorough description of how
exhibitions are arranged according to forms and eras.
