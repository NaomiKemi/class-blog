## There are clear hierarchies of knowledge(s). Why do these hierarchies exist and who/what do they benefit?

Knowledge hierarchies reflect the social and political power of the social and political structure of a society. Historically knowledge has been used as a tool for social control, which specific corporations or certain groups that are in charge regulating who have access to it as well as how it is formed and distributed. Companies and groups abuse their influence to decide what type of knowledge is deemed valuable or important and to control who may have access to it. The groups that control to hold the power and control over society by limiting the flow of information and knowledge. In the colonial era, European powers had much control over the diffusion and creation of knowledge about non-western cultures, frequently portraying them as barbaric and inferior. The hierarchy of knowledge favoured colonisers. Today, hierarchies of knowledge are still present but in a variety of forms for example newspapers and the media have control over the stories that get circulate to a wider audience it restricts the ability to hear other points of view and ideas.

## What does this have to do with Digital Innovation?
### “The digital” as conduit of power

Power plays a massive role in digital innovation because it influences how and what new technologies are created, applied, and managed. The progression of digital innovation is not neutral; rather, it is impacted by several social, political, and economic variables, including power relations. Technology control is one of the many examples of the impact power has in digital innovation; the use and the digital impact of digital technologies is massively influenced by those who have great influence over production and distribution. For instance, big internet firms like Facebook and google exercise an enormous influence on how we engage, communicate, and access information online. Another example of big of an impact power has in digital innovation is impact on society; Advancements in digital innovation has a range of social and economic effects from redefining cultural norms and values to opening new opportunities. Those that have the power to form the extent and direction of digital innovation will have considerable impact on how society will progress in the future. It’s crucial that digital innovators to consider how the work fits into larger social and political settings, this may entail fostering greater openness and accountability, developing access to technology and information and underlying causes of power inequalities in online environments.

## Why should we study Foucault, knowledge-power and curation as digital innovators?

Digital Innovators can benefit from studying Michael Foucault’s writings, notably his theories on knowledge and power and how they relate to the process of curation. Digital innovators may notice power dynamics in online environments by using Foucault's theories about power as a persuasive force that functions through various social structures and practises. Innovators are more likely to develop technologies and systems which are more just and equal if they have a better understanding of how power function in these settings. By applying Foucault’s idea digital innovators can evaluate knowledge and information that they present for audiences. Innovation can develop more and informed platforms by focusing on the process on which knowledge is created, exchanged, and endorsed. In online contexts, where information is accessible and easy to obtain, Foucault’s theories of curation can be used. Innovators may be able to design more efficient and ethical ways for arranging and transmitting data by understanding how curation impacts what is seen and how it may be viewed. To summarize studying Foucault’s concepts can assist innovators in designing more mindful and responsible solutions by supporting them in a way to better understand social, political, and cultural environment in which technologies function.
