In terms of just being able to read and write, my understanding of literacy is extremely 
basic. Eloise, who is of Chinese origin, tells me through a blog entry written by a person 
who can speak both English and Chinese that literacy is something that is helpful for her. 
Being multilingual enables you to interact with individuals from all over the world, which 
might help you overcome unpleasant situations and linguistic obstacles. We see classes 
inside the CCI that encourage us, the students, to utilise code to produce "art" works by 
using fundamental coding languages like JavaScript and python, therefore the debate over 
whether programmers can be creative by using coding or not is extremely interesting. 
But I do think that's when the concepts of literacy and coding start to converge because 
you need to have a fundamental grasp of coding languages to do this. While there are many 
methods to accomplish a goal with code, whereas literacy is fairly organised, you might not
be able to generate particular work if you only know the basics of the language. I think
that everyone should learn how to code, but that it should be considered more as a skill 
for creating technical works of art than as a means of communicating with other people.
