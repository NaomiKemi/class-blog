# Low tech magazine by Marie Otsuka and Roel Roscam

The magazine stimulates thoughts of opposing the traditional understanding of wisdom of our 
technological dependence may be found in the low-tech magazine that Marie Otsuka and Roel Roscam 
developed. It's a good idea to have a backup plan in case the backup plan fails. Although high 
tech solutions have numerous advantages, there are several unintended consequences that may 
have an impact on both individuals and the environment. The authors stress the sustainability
of low-tech solutions by emphasising their affordability and environmental friendliness while 
advocating for a more human-centred approach to technology.

High-tech solutions have advantages, but they frequently have significant unintended 
environmental consequences. Although it may seem like these solutions are more effective
and efficient, Marie and Roel explain that they frequently take more energy to develop, run, 
and maintain. The environment and society may suffer because of energy consumption. 
According to their statement, they production and consumption of technology, especially 
high-tech solutions, contribute significantly to environmental degradation and resource 
depletion (Otsuka and Roscam). The quote emphasises the harm done to the ecosystem. 
The reason for this is that the extraction and processing of natural resources are 
frequently used in the manufacturing process of these technologies, which can result in 
resource depletion and environmental deterioration. Using technology also results in more 
energy being used and electronic waste being produced, which further damages the environment.

Another key point made by both authors is that low tech solutions can promote a more 
human-centred approach to technology. They highlight the fact that while high tech solutions
are defined to efficient, but they can be alienating and dehumanizing, On the other hand low 
tech solutions are designed to be more intuitive and accessible, and promotes a sense of 
inclusivity, community, and connection. As they state, “low tech encourages human participation,
creativity, and diversity, and generates more social and economic interactions” This quote 
explores more the benefits of a low form of technology. It promotes the argument that these 
technologies allow more social and economic interactions, creating a more vibrant and 
interconnected community in contrast to high tech approaches. Low tech solutions can lead to 
a stronger relation between groups and individuals who work together on projects.

I feel the whole magazine promotes the importance of sustainability in technological advancements.
Before reading this, I didn’t understand the affects technology could have on the environment. 
Through reading this article it pushed me to shift my mindset from constantly seeking efficiency
to focusing on reducing the overall consumption for resources and I believe that’s quite present
in apple products. The iPhone continues to develop with every new upgrade of the phone, apple 
incorporates cutting – edge technologies to make life easier but they are not environmentally 
friendly due to several factors. Firstly, during the manufacturing process involves extraction 
and processing of rare mentals like gold and cobalt which can have a significant impact on the 
environment in terms of pollution and carbon footprint. The companies also intentionally design 
its devices to become outdated after a few years so that customers will be compelled to buy newer
models causing electronic waste that ends up in landfills or being exported to developing 
countries for disposal.

Ultimately, Low Tech Magazine serves as a reminder of the value of embracing simplicity 
and being aware of our environmental effect. We can lower our carbon footprint while still 
meeting our requirements and maintaining a high standard of living by implementing low-tech 
alternatives.
