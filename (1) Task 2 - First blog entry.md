# Are social media platforms starting to drive out their black creators?

## *Being an influencer seems like something easy to do* . But having a certain image or complexion can make it easier.

You go on social media, and there are endless pictures of them enjoying exquisitely prepared dinners, floating on pink flamingos in beautiful blue pools, 
and photographing massive hauls of luxury goods. With their big smiles and consistent Instagram lives documenting their lives, 
it may seem like the outside world has no effect on them whatsoever; however, in the online community, there are massive issues of 
inequality that are quite persistent in the life of a black creator.

Much of the online culture takes massive inspiration from black influencers and creators, but they get little to no recognition at all, 
whether it's credit, payment, deals, or followers. Instead, they have their white counterparts on the platform getting credit for something 
a black influencer createdIf these platforms continue to not give the original recognition to the black creators, this will be an incentive for these creators 
to stop making content, eventually pushing them off platforms that should be open to everyone. The recent increase in black content creators having their videos 
taken down, being muted when posting Black Lives Matter content, and black women being paid less for what they post on social media made me want to dig deeper 
into this topic to see if there was a way platforms could ensure everyone is paid fairly or if they could look at how new creators of colour could rebuild their black communities.

Using Helen Newing's techniques, from my title, I identified the key words, which were "black creators" and "social media." Prior to Helen's advice, 
I would have searched my entire question to find similar resources that discussed the same topic.There are many things that fall under social media,
which is the name of the platforms, i.e., TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter.The more successful searches were when I said the platform specifically, especially using the word TikTok, 
as that’s where most of the black creators have voiced out their frustrations with certain platforms more than others. Because the world of social media was so vast, it was difficult 
to find the information I was looking for. Helen also said to add in a joining word for when you want the words to be treated separately. The searches that used a joining word were 
more unsuccessful as I wanted to talk about black creators' experiences or mistreatment on these platforms, and when these words are treated separately, most of the resources don’t 
investigate the problems of the black creators, just talk about black creators on social media. Moving forward, I will separate each platform, as different platforms are not reacting 
the same way to black content creators. I also found that Google had more resources. I believe the Google search yielded numerous results.
