## “What is literacy and what does it mean to call computer programming a literacy?” (around 250 words)

Before reading the text, I assumed that literacy just meant the capacity for reading and writing. These abilities enable individuals to communicate effectively, talk clearly, listen to others, and develop an awareness of the world around them. Because the world is constantly changing and evolving and because children are constantly learning to adapt to those changes through communication and listening to others, literacy development is a crucial component of adolescent development. The inability to communicate oneself clearly as a child or to enter the labour market at a young age are two examples of how lacking essential reading skills can hinder someone at all stages of life. This generational progression makes social mobility makes it harder to achieve social mobility and a more equitable society. The same way that it's common for kids to learn how to read and write, computer programming may also be seen as a fundamental ability that's crucial to master because it can be viewed as a component of communication skills. linking writing and communication skills with programming from a perspective that is evolving along with engineering and computation. It is possible to think of computer programming as a machine language. From a learning viewpoint, learning to read and write in code is like learning to read and write in any other language, hence teaching code is like teaching literacy.
