Task 2:

Are social media platforms starting to drive out their black creators?

Being an influencer seems like something easy to do. But having a certain image or complexion can make it easier.
You go on social media and its endless pictures of them enjoy exquisitely prepared dinners, floating on pink flamingos in beautiful blue pools, and photographs of massive hauls of luxury goods. The big smiles, consistent Instagram lives documenting their lives it may seem like the outside world has no effect on them whatsoever, however in the online community there are massive issues of inequality that is quite persistent in a life of a black creator.
Much of the online culture takes massive inspiration from black influencers and creators are they get little to no recognition at all whether its credit, payment, deals, or followers. Instead, they have their white counter parts on the platform getting credit for something a black influencer created. If these platforms continue to not give the original recognition to the black creators this will be an incentive for these creators to stop making content and eventually pushing them out of platforms that should be open to everyone. The recent increase of black content creators getting their videos taken down, muted when posting Black Lives Matter content to black women getting paid less for what their social post made me want to research this topic further to see if there could be a way platform can make sure everyone is getting paid fair or look at a new creators of colour can build their black communities back.

Using Helen Newing techniques, from my title I identify the key words which was “black creators” and “social media”. Prior to the tips that I learnt from Helen I would have searched my whole question in to see similar resources that were speaking about that exact topic. There are many things that fall under social media which is the names of the platforms i.e. TikTok, Instagram or twitter. The more successful searches were when I said the platform specifically especially using the word TikTok as that’s where most of the black creators have voiced out their frustrations for which certain platforms more than others. Using the world social media was so wide it wasn’t as specific so the information I was looking for was hard to find. Helen also said add in a joining word for when you want the words to be treated separately, the searches that used a joining word more unsuccessful as I wanted to talk about black creator’s experience or mistreatment on these platforms and when these words are treated separately most of the resources didn’t investigate the problems of the black creators just talks about black creators on social media. Moving forward I will separate each platform as different platforms are not reacting the same for black content creators.
