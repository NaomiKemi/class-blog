As opposed to Quanzhu's blog article, where she noted that literacy meant being able to 
communicate with other people both orally and in writing. Jingyi defines literacy as a 
computer's capacity to comprehend a programming language. She emphasised that the reason 
why computer programming is literacy is that a computer can translate human ideas, but I 
think there could have been a clear distinction between what they believe computer literacy
is and what the dictionary definition of literacy is so I could have understood the 
comparison and why they think computer programming should be considered literacy. Following
their reading of the supplied literature, students continued by describing the intricacy of
programming, demonstrating the distinction between fundamental literacy and the description
of computer languages as literacy. Parents and societal programming can demand a lot of 
training to understand advanced topics. Parents teach literacy to children at such a 
pre-school level.
