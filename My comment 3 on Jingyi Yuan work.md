Jingyi begins by detailing the exterior and interior of the building to give me a 
sense of what the design museums look like. In contrast to Quanzhu's blog post, Jingyi 
explains how the museum's layout gives visitors the freedom to wander around the grounds 
and observe numerous exhibits. Also, they maintained the blog by focusing on what the 
artistic creations were intended to achieve, emphasising that the designs serve more 
purposes than simply pleasing the eye of the audience. The images helped me much comprehend
why these items were chosen to be on exhibit because each one was distinctive and painted 
a picture of the artist's style.A good exhibit must also have a clear story in addition to 
being composed of the most appropriate object.
