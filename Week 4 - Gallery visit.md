### How is this computational, according to you?
Using computer algorithms to produce visual representations of individuals, computational portraiture is a type of digital art. It incorporates methods from several disciplines, including image processing, computer graphics, machine learning, and computer vision. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and other deep learning models are used in Chelsi Cocking's computational portraiture method to create realistic portraits. An image generator that creates images and a discriminator that compares the generated images to actual ones make up a GAN, a sort of neural network. To teach her GANs how to create realistic-looking portraits with styles or qualities, Cocking trains them on big datasets of human faces. To create portraits from non-visual information, she also tries with alternative input data types like audio recordings and text descriptions. Generally, computational portraiture by Cocking is viewed as "computational" since it mainly utilises data-driven methods and machine learning algorithms to produce digital artworks that resemble humans.
What topic is the piece/artist exploring, according to you? 
Her prior works and statements indicate that she is investigating how technology and human emotions interact in her computational portraiture. She creates portraits using algorithms that emphasise a person's inner emotional condition over their outward appearance. Her work poses concerns about identity, privacy, and the effect of technology on how we perceive one another and ourselves.
What other pieces of art are exploring a similar topic, and how are these pieces of art exploring the topic differently?
Mexican-Canadian artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer is well recognised for his interactive installations that frequently use biometric information like fingerprints and heartbeats. In his 2006 piece "Pulse Room," a room full of light bulbs flash in response to the guests' heartbeats. Golan Levin is a different media artist that experiments with algorithmic portraiture. In his 2017 effort "Augmented Face," he combined numerous faces into a single real-time video portrait using computer vision algorithms. These artists use computational methods to investigate topics of technology and identity, but their methods and techniques vary. Whereas Lozano-work Hemmer's stresses involvement with viewers' biometric data, Cocking's work focuses more on the use of machine learning algorithms to construct portraits based on massive datasets. By letting viewers utilise digital tools to change their own facial features in real-time, Levin's art adopts a more whimsical style.
Which parts/aspects/elements of this piece of art do you enjoy the most?
Chelsi Cocking uses machine learning techniques in some intriguing aspects of her computational portraiture. She employs a variety of machine learning approaches to produce one-of-a-kind portraits that perfectly express her topics. Her blend of traditional and digital art is another facet of her work that I appreciate. Her artwork mixes conventional painting methods with digital technologies to produce paintings that are incredibly beautiful. She examines face characteristics and expressions to uncover hidden truths about her subjects as she explores the concept of identity in her artwork.
Which parts (if any) could have been developed further, according to you?
The incorporation of feelings is one of the areas that may have been improved. While the model properly reproduced facial characteristics like the eyes and mouth, it fell short of reliably capturing facial expressions and emotions. By creating algorithms to recognise and represent various emotional states, the realism of these pictures may be improved. Adding interactive elements is another way she may improve her portraits; at the moment, the created portraits are static images that don't react to user input or interactions. The portraits could become more interactive by include components like voice recognition or movement. There is still need for growth in terms of accuracy, diversity, interactivity, and ethics, even if Chelsi's computational portraiture project is amazing in its capacity to produce lifelike portraits from limited input data.
Which skills does the artist have that distinguish them from other artists?
Displaying a unique fusion of technical proficiency, creative insight, and aesthetic sensitivity. The aesthetic impact and technical prowess of Cockings' computational portraiture are amazing. Because of her technical expertise in computer science and programming, she can employ software tools and algorithms to create her portraits. Her understanding for this also develops a sense of attention to detail to ensure correctness and precision in the result.
Does this piece inspire you? If so, how?
She has created something that is always fresh and fascinating, demonstrating to me that there are no limits to what can be done with creativity. Her work also encourages me to investigate the potential of artificial intelligence and see how it may be used in other industries. The computational portraits created by Chelsi Cockings encourage us by displaying the virtually limitless possibilities that technology presents for the creation of art and design.
What can you take away from this piece of art? How has studying this piece (potentially) changed your creative practice?
Nonetheless, it can be concluded from my examination of Chelsi Cocking's computational portraiture that using technology in the arts can transcend conventional limitations and produce unexpected results. Cocking's work demonstrates how data-driven algorithms may be used to produce distinctive and beautiful portraits. This shows how integrating technology into one's creative process can lead to creative and unexpected outcomes. However, her work also implies that experimentation with different techniques and mediums is crucial to creativity. People may get a new perspective on their own artistic endeavours by studying Cocking's method. They might start to think about using technology to explore other modes of expression or come up with new ideas. Also, they can be more willing to experiment with novel tools, substances, or ideas in their profession.
Give context about the Prize and include information from the interviews with the artist that can be found on the website.
The BLOOMBERG NEW CONTEMPORARIES 2022 prize is a highly anticipated event that showcases the work of emerging artists from the UK. The exhibition features a diverse range of art forms, including sculpture, painting, and photography. Among the talented artists featured in this year's exhibition are Rudy Loewe and Sherrie Sitzauze. In an interview, Loewe discussed their exploration of themes such as gender identity and race through their artwork, while Sitzauze focuses on the intersectionality between Blackness and queerness. Both artists demonstrate a commitment to creating thought-provoking pieces that challenge societal norms and offer new perspectives on contemporary issues. Overall, the BLOOMBERG NEW CONTEMPORARIES 2022 prize provides a platform for exciting new talent in the UK art scene and offers insight into some of the most pressing topics facing society today.
