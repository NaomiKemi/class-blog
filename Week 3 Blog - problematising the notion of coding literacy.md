Following the reading of "Coding Literacy" by Vee Annette, a few fresh ideas emerge that serve to undermine the concept of coding literacy. Coding can be viewed as a type of language and communication rather than just a technical talent, which is one of the primary ideas in the article. This disproves the notion that learning to code is solely important for people who want to work in technology or in computer science and instead says that knowing how to code is a crucial skill that everyone should have to successfully navigate our increasingly digital environment.


Annette also brings up crucial issues such as who has access to coding materials and education, and how this affects chances for underrepresented groups. She makes the case that conventional methods of teaching coding frequently give preference to types of knowledge and modes of learning, which may exclude people from backgrounds that are underrepresented. As she states, " At its core, computational thinking may still reproduce inequities due to its focus on logic, abstraction, and decontextualized problem-solving." This demonstrates the need for approaches to teaching coding literacy that are more inclusive and culturally sensitive.
When Annette says, " The skills required for effective participation in contemporary society include not only standard literacies but also computational fluency â€“ an understanding of how technologies shape the social world," it really motivates me to look more carefully about these concerns. This assertion recognises the important part that technology plays in determining our daily lives and social connections. Additionally, it highlights the significance of viewing coding literacy to engage with technology critically rather than just learning technical abilities.

Overall, "Coding Literacy" provides insightful information about the difficulties associated with coding education and its broader social implications. Annette's work inspires us to reflect more thoroughly on how we approach teaching technology-related skills and empowering people from different backgrounds by challenging conventional assumptions of what constitutes "code literacy" and exposing concerns linked to fairness and access.
