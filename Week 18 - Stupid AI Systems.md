Critical Studies: Week 18 Homework
Requirement.
Homework:
Write up your 'stupid' Al system for your journal.
In 500 words, explore the benefits and implications of developing such a system.
Consider questions such as:
- What do we mean by "stupid" Al?
-How mighta "stupid" Al system be different from a highly intelligentone?
-What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of creating a "stupid" Al system?
-How might such a system challenge our assumptions about intelligence and agency?
-What ethical considerations would need to be taken into account when developing a "stupid Al system?


Even though artificial intelligence has various definitions (AI). The following definition, however, is provided by John McCarthy in his 2004 work "What is Artificial Intelligence?" (2007), 
‘It is the science and engineering of making similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable”.
Artificial intelligence is founded on the idea that human intelligence can be described in a way that makes it simple for a computer to imitate it and carry out activities of all complexity levels.

The term "dumb" is highly relative and subjective. Artificial stupidity in this context refers to an artificial intelligence system that has been purposefully "dumbed down" to make it more 
approachable, practical, or aesthetically acceptable to the user but lacks advanced learning capabilities. For instance, a game bot could be programmed to choose actions that are not optimal 
given the skill of the human players.

Early AI had limited knowledge of the outside world, and many departments lacked the tools necessary to fully utilize them. I believe that the word weak is a better alternative to the word stupid. 
This unreliable AI has been honed and directed to carry out tasks. Much of the AI that surrounds us now is driven by several weak AI. The robust applications produced by this form of AI include Apple's Siri, 
Amazon Alexa, and driverless vehicles. Strong AI can have sophisticated cognitive skills like logical reasoning, problem-solving abilities, learning potential, and language comprehension. Ais is a highly 
intelligent system that uses machine learning and algorithms to accomplish difficult tasks and make judgements based on vast volumes of data. Theoretically, these AI forms are smarter than humans and are 
more self-aware (e.g. Boden, 2017; Shneiderman, 2020b).

Weak AI can evaluate massive volumes of data and make judgements based on that data, which is one benefit it offers. This makes it possible for firms to decide fast and effectively. Moreover, it is 
possible to automate menial chores with weak AI, freeing up resources for more worthwhile endeavors. Finally, weak AI can be used to find patterns in data that would be hard to find otherwise.

Some drawbacks of weak AI systems, that was pointed out by Briana Brownell founder of PureStrategy.ai pointed out that in the case of AI related to image recognition there is usually a high number 
of examples to accurately learn something relatively simple: to determine whether a photo is of a cat or a dog. When AI which excels at this, turning into a very close task to say whether the photo 
of a pug or pig or loaf of bread, in the film “The Mitchell’s vs the machines” showed that the photo of the big doesn’t transfer well” playing on the AI is stupid (delponte,2009).

Any type of artificial intelligence development must carefully consider moral concerns, including privacy, security, fairness, accountability, transparency, and safety considerations. This includes 
preventing harm from unintended consequences like discrimination against specific groups because of inaccurate identification.
