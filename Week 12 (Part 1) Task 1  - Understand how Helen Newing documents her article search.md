## Information sources: libraries, databases, online search engines … and people
* Main sources of information are academic libraries and online sources

* Set yourself a rough time limit, after review where it’s enough
* An initial search to find one or two recent reviejws should take less than an hour 

## Information management: keeping records of what searches you have done
* Series of successive steps at more and more specific level
* Each stage informs the next, its essential to keep a record of where you have searched, what search terms you have used and what you have found 
* Records will save time and stop you from repeating searches
* References details can be initially cut and paste into a word or excel document to create a list
* You can organize by subtopics so that you can find the references on each subtopic easily 
* When downloading full text of articles, it is useful to store them separate folders according to subtopics

* Read it right through and make notes summarizing key concepts, arguments, and examples
* Working from electronic source, it will be useful to copy and paste key sections into your notes 
* Read through your notes when finished
